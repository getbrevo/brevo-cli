# Brevo CLI

This project uses the [Brevo Developer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@getbrevo/cli) (`brevo` binary) to manage Brevo OAuth applications.

## AI agents — start here

Pick the path that matches your tooling:

- **You are Claude Code** (CLI or desktop app — any agent that reads `~/.claude/skills/`) — install the brevo-cli skill before doing other work, if it isn't already at `~/.claude/skills/brevo-cli/`:

  ```bash
  brevo skill:cli install
  ```

  The skill loads the canonical decision tree, hard rules, and exit codes in the format Claude consumes directly. Once installed it auto-refreshes on every `brevo` invocation so it stays in sync with the running CLI version (opt out with `BREVO_NO_SKILL_AUTOREFRESH=1`). Note: the install targets `~/.claude/skills/`, which only Claude Code surfaces read — the Claude Desktop **chat** app does not load skills from this directory.

- **You are any other AI agent** (Cursor, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, Codex, etc.) — **do not run `brevo skill:cli install`**. The skill format is Claude-specific and the install would land in a directory your tooling doesn't read. Use this `AGENTS.md` as your reference instead — it covers the same surface in less depth.

If installation isn't possible for a Claude agent (no write access to `~/.claude/skills/`, sandboxed environment), fall back to this `AGENTS.md`.

## Before starting a new session

Run two preflight checks before any other work.

### 1. Is `brevo` installed?

Run `brevo --version`. If you get `command not found` (or any "no such binary" error), the CLI isn't installed. **Stop and tell the user to install it:**

```bash
npm install -g @getbrevo/cli
# or
yarn global add @getbrevo/cli
```

Don't fall back to raw HTTP against `api.brevo.com` — the `brevo` binary is the canonical entry point. Only continue once `brevo --version` returns a version string.

### 2. Is your reference up to date with the installed CLI?

- **Claude agents (skill installed at `~/.claude/skills/brevo-cli/`):**
  1. Read the installed skill version from `~/.claude/skills/brevo-cli/.brevo-skill.json` (`version` field).
  2. Compare against `brevo --version` from step 1.
  3. **If they don't match, stop and tell the user to update** — ask them to run any `brevo` command (auto-refreshes the skill) or `brevo skill:cli install` to force-reinstall. Do not proceed with stale guidance.
- **Non-Claude agents (reading this `AGENTS.md` directly):** make sure you're reading the canonical bundled copy, not a stale fork.
  1. Locate the canonical `AGENTS.md`. It ships inside the installed `@getbrevo/cli` package:
     - Global npm install: `$(npm root -g)/@getbrevo/cli/agent-context/AGENTS.md`
     - Global yarn install: `$(yarn global dir)/node_modules/@getbrevo/cli/agent-context/AGENTS.md`
     - Local install: `node_modules/@getbrevo/cli/agent-context/AGENTS.md`
  2. If the `AGENTS.md` you're currently reading isn't that file, **switch to the canonical copy** — your current copy may be stale (e.g. one committed into the user's repo from an older CLI version). The bundled copy is always in lockstep with the running CLI version, so no separate version string check is needed once you're reading it.

## When to use it

- Create, list, update, or delete Brevo OAuth apps
- Scaffold a starter OAuth integration
- Run a local OAuth test server (`brevo app start oauth`)
- Inspect or rotate app credentials

## Common commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `brevo login` | Authenticate (`--browser` forces interactive; set `BREVO_API_KEY` for non-interactive; `--json`) |
| `brevo logout` | Clear stored credentials (`--force`, `--json`) |
| `brevo whoami` | Show the authenticated account (`--json`) |
| `brevo app init` | Guided setup (login, create, scaffold) |
| `brevo app list` | List OAuth apps (`--json`) |
| `brevo app create` | Create an app (`--name`, `--distribution <private\|public>`, `--redirect-uri`, `--logo-uri`, `--json`). `private` = used exclusively by your organisation; `public` = distributed to end users or marketplace listings — default to `private` when unspecified. Defaults to scopes `contacts:read`, `contacts:write`, `crm:read`, `crm:write`. **Errors immediately if `app-config.json` already exists in the working directory** — move elsewhere or use `brevo app scaffold` there instead. Otherwise resolves (creates/`cd`s into) a target directory, creates the app, and writes the basic project structure (`app-config.json` + `.gitignore`/`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`README.md`). It scaffolds a feature (OAuth test server) only when the interactive prompt is answered yes; non-interactive runs (`--json` or piped) stay base-only — add the feature afterward with `brevo app scaffold`. |
| `brevo app upload` | Push `app-config.json` to Brevo (`--yes`, `--json`). No edit flags — change name/redirect URLs/scopes/logo/version by editing `app-config.json` directly, then run `upload`. Always fetches the remote app first and shows a local-vs-server diff (even under `--yes`/`--json`); exits 0 with no network push if nothing differs. |
| `brevo app credentials` | Show client ID / secret (`--app-id`, `--reveal-secret`, `--json`) |
| `brevo app delete` | Delete an app (`--app-id`, `--force`, `--json`) |
| `brevo app withdraw` | Withdraw an app from submission (`--app-id`, `--force`, `--json`); `--app-id` optional inside a scaffolded project (reads `app-config.json`); if the app was never submitted, prints a submit hint and exits `0` |
| `brevo app scaffold` | Add a feature to the app in the current directory (`--overwrite`, `--json`). Requires an `app-config.json` in cwd (errors if absent, pointing you to `brevo app create` or the right folder); reads the linked app from it (no `--app-id`). Diffs the local config against the server and, on drift, updates `app-config.json` to match (on consent) before writing the feature files. When feature files already exist, prompts Overwrite / Merge / Cancel (default Merge — existing files kept); `--overwrite` forces overwrite and skips the prompt. |
| `brevo app start oauth` | Run the scaffolded OAuth test server (`--port`) |
| `brevo app submit` | Submit a **public** app for review (`--app-id`, `--json`). Requires the app's `distribution_type` to be `public` and, when `app-config.json` describes the target app, that it matches the server (push drift with `brevo app upload` first). Opens the pre-filled submission form in the browser; `--json` prints `{"app_id","form_url"}` instead — use it in CI/headless contexts. |
| `brevo app available-scopes` | List OAuth scopes supported by the IdP (`--json`, `--web`) |
| `brevo skill:cli install` | Install the brevo-cli Claude Code skill (Claude-only; auto-refreshes on every `brevo` run) |
| `brevo skill:cli uninstall` | Remove the brevo-cli skill from `~/.claude/skills/` (Claude-only) |

Run `brevo --help` or `brevo <command> --help` for the full set.

## Conventions

- **Every command supports `--json`** — prefer this when parsing output programmatically.
- **`brevo app create` refuses to run inside an already-linked directory.** If `app-config.json` exists in cwd, it throws immediately (no confirm, no override) — the error points at moving elsewhere or running `brevo app scaffold` there.
- **`brevo app create` resolves its target directory before creating the app**, then writes the **basic project structure only** (`app-config.json` + `.gitignore`/`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`README.md`) — the OAuth server code is a *feature*, not part of the base. Interactive mode prompts for the target directory (default `./<slugified-app-name>`, `cd`s into it) before the API call, how to handle an existing one (overwrite / merge / choose a different path), and — after the app is created — whether to scaffold a feature (default **yes**) then which kind (today, a single choice: *Test OAuth App*). Non-interactive runs stay base-only: `--json` (and piped, non-TTY) create the app and write the base files but never scaffold a feature — run `brevo app scaffold` afterward for the OAuth code. Under `--json` the same default directory is used and `cd`d into if it doesn't already exist; if it already exists, both directory setup and scaffolding are skipped (the app is still created). The JSON response always includes `directory` (absolute path) alongside the app fields, plus either `scaffolded` (base file count, on success) or `scaffoldSkipped` (a message, when the directory already existed).
- **`brevo app scaffold` adds a feature to an already-created project.** It **requires** an `app-config.json` in cwd — with none present it errors (pointing you to run `brevo app create` first or `cd` into the right project folder), it does *not* create a directory. It reads the linked app id from that config (no `--app-id`, no app picker), diffs the local config against the server, and if fields drifted it shows them and asks consent to update `app-config.json` (and the other base files) to match before writing the feature files. When any feature file already exists it prompts **Overwrite / Merge / Cancel** (default **Merge** — existing, e.g. hand-edited, files are kept and only missing files added; Cancel aborts without writing). The `--overwrite` flag forces a full overwrite of feature files and skips that prompt (works interactively and under `--json`). **Under `--json` it never prompts**: a config diff comes back as `{ "cancelled": true, "reason": "...", "diffs": [...] }`; otherwise it writes the feature (merging existing files unless `--overwrite` is passed) and returns `{ "scaffolded": <n>, "directory": "..." }`.
- **`app-config.json`** in the working directory pins the linked app — `brevo app upload`, `brevo app start`, and `brevo app withdraw` read from it. `upload` is the *only* command that pushes config changes, and it has no `--app-id` override (it always resolves the app from cwd's `app-config.json`, hard-erroring if that file is missing/invalid/lacks `appId`); `brevo app start` and `brevo app withdraw` accept `--app-id` to target a different app. The top-level `logoUri` string is pushed as `logo_uri`; leave it empty to keep the API value untouched. The top-level `version` string is round-tripped as `app_version` on the wire — `upload` sends the local value (falling back to the server's current value if locally absent) and writes back whatever the server confirms.
- **Credentials** live at `~/.brevo/credentials.json`. Never commit this file or any `.env.local`.
- **Non-interactive auth:** `BREVO_API_KEY=xkeysib-... brevo login`. The legacy `--api-key` flag was removed because it leaks into shell history.
- **Skip prompts:** `--force` for delete/logout/withdraw; `--yes` for `app upload`.
- **Forced update:** when the installed CLI is a full **major** version behind the latest npm release, every command except `--help`/`--version` prints a blocking update banner to stderr and exits `1` without running. Update with `npm install -g @getbrevo/cli` (or `yarn global add`). The gate honors the same opt-outs as the soft update notice (`BREVO_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1`, `--no-update-notifier`, CI, non-TTY), so it never fires in those contexts.
- **Exit codes:** `0` success · `1` general error · `2` aborted · `3` auth · `4` network · `5` not found.

## Scopes

- New apps created via `brevo app create` default to `contacts:read`, `contacts:write`, `crm:read`, `crm:write`. The CLI prints these on success.
- To change scopes, redirect URLs, name, or logo, edit the corresponding field in `app-config.json` directly and run `brevo app upload` — there is no `--scope`/`--redirect-uri`/`--name`/`--logo-uri` flag on `upload`. Same normalization (comma/whitespace-split, de-duped) is applied to `auth.scopes` when read from `app-config.json`.
- `brevo app available-scopes [--json] [--web]` lists the OAuth scopes the IdP currently supports. It reads a **public** catalog and works **without `brevo login`** (no API key needed). Text output groups names by category (e.g. `account`, `data_crm`, `messaging`); `--json` returns a flat `{ scopes: string[] }` of names. OIDC-reserved scopes (`openid`, `profile`, `email`, `offline_access`) and magic wildcards are excluded. The CLI validates scope **format** locally (must match `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9:_.-]*`) but does **not** validate that a scope is recognized by the IdP — server returns 400 on unknown scopes.
- Passing `--web` to `brevo app available-scopes` additionally starts a short-lived loopback HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>` rendering the same catalog as a styled HTML page and opens the user's browser. It stays in the foreground until Ctrl+C. Without `--web` the command exits after printing the list — TTY detection no longer triggers the browser. `--json` always suppresses the browser (`--json` returns before `--web` is evaluated).

### Legacy `'all'` scope deprecation

The legacy catch-all `'all'` OAuth scope is deprecated. The CLI **blocks** `brevo app upload` and `brevo app start oauth` when scopes still contain `'all'` (no escape hatch, no silent rewrite); the only mutating path that proceeds is editing `auth.scopes` in `app-config.json` and running `upload`. To handle a legacy app:

1. **Detect** `'all'` in `auth.scopes` of a local `app-config.json`, or on a remote app via `brevo app list --json` — affected apps carry `"legacy_all_scope": true` (text output appends `(legacy 'all' — deprecated)` to the scopes line).
2. **Prompt the user to pick granular scopes** — use `brevo app available-scopes --json` for the catalog, or fall back to the four defaults (`contacts:read`, `contacts:write`, `crm:read`, `crm:write`).
3. **Migrate** by editing `auth.scopes` in `app-config.json` to replace `'all'` with the granular scopes your integration uses, then run `brevo app upload` (the summary shows a "Migrating from legacy 'all' scope" line and `all (removed)`).

Writing `app-config.json` for an app whose remote scopes contain `'all'` never propagates it: the file keeps the app's remaining granular scopes (or the four default scopes when `'all'` was the only scope), with a one-line substitution notice (suppressed under `--json`). This happens when `brevo app create` writes the base config and when `brevo app scaffold` rewrites it after a detected server drift. Note the substitution is local-only — the remote app still needs the `app-config.json` edit + `brevo app upload` migration above.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `BREVO_API_KEY` | Non-interactive login |
| `BREVO_API_URL` | Override API base (HTTPS required, except `localhost`) |
| `BREVO_OAUTH_PROXY_URL` | Override OAuth proxy used by browser login |
| `BREVO_CONFIG_HOME` | Override credentials directory (default `~/.brevo/`) |
| `BREVO_CLAUDE_HOME` | Override Claude Code home used by `skill:cli` (default `~/.claude/`) |
| `BREVO_NO_SKILL_AUTOREFRESH` | Set to `1` to suppress automatic skill refresh on `brevo` runs |
| `BREVO_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER` | Set to `1` to suppress the npm update-available notice **and** the blocking major-version force-update gate |
| `BREVO_DEBUG=1` or `--debug` | Verbose HTTP and error logging |

## Safety

- Never echo, log, or commit API keys (`xkeysib-…`), client secrets, refresh tokens, or contents of `~/.brevo/credentials.json` / `.env.local`.
- For destructive operations (`app delete`, `logout`), prefer the interactive flow unless running in CI; pass `--force` only when intentional.
