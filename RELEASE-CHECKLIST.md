| `## Per-branch verification` | **Scratch.** Per-branch working state — clear it before merging the branch into `main`, but keep the file and the section heading. |

## Before public-apps GA

Public app distribution is not live on the Brevo platform, so the agent-facing
docs carry a **⚠️ Public apps are not available yet** notice telling agents never
to create a public app or drive the review lifecycle (`app submit` / `app status`
/ `app withdraw`). See `CLAUDE.md` → *Public app distribution is not GA* for why.

**When public apps go GA, remove the notice everywhere in one pass:**

- [ ] `agent-context/SKILL.md`
  - [ ] Delete the `## ⚠️ Public apps are not available yet` section, including its
        *Exception — deliberate testing* clause.
  - [ ] Decision tree — "Create an app": restore `--distribution <private|public>`
        and the private-vs-public guidance ("`private` for apps used exclusively by
        the user's own organisation, `public` for apps distributed to end users or
        marketplace listings; default to `private` when the user hasn't said which").
  - [ ] Decision tree — drop the **not available yet** prefix from "Check an app's
        review status", "Submit a public app for review", and "Withdraw an app from
        submission".
  - [ ] Hard rules — delete rule 6 (*Never create a public app*).
- [ ] `agent-context/AGENTS.md`
  - [ ] Delete the `## ⚠️ Public apps are not available yet` section, including its
        *Exception — deliberate testing* clause.
  - [ ] Common commands table — restore `--distribution <private|public>` plus the
        private-vs-public guidance on the `brevo app create` row.
  - [ ] Common commands table — drop the **⚠️ Not available yet** prefix from the
        `brevo app status`, `brevo app submit`, and `brevo app withdraw` rows.
  - [ ] Conventions — delete the *Public apps are not available yet* bullet.
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` — delete the `## Public app distribution is not GA` section.
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` (repo root) — delete the `## Public app distribution is not GA`
      section.
- [ ] `README.md`
  - [ ] Restore `--distribution private\|public` on the `brevo app create` row.
  - [ ] Delete the **⚠️ Public apps are not available yet** blockquote below the
        commands table.
- [ ] `QA-TESTCASES.md` — delete the **⚠️ Public apps are not available to end users
      yet** blockquote (if the file still exists; it's per-branch scratch).
- [ ] Verify nothing was missed:
      `grep -rn "Public apps are not available yet" --include="*.md" .`
      (excluding `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `coverage/`) returns only this file.
- [ ] Delete this whole `## Before public-apps GA` section — and if
      `## Per-branch verification` is empty, delete the file and drop the
      *Working docs* reference to it from `CLAUDE.md`.

**Related follow-ups (not blockers for GA removal):**

- [ ] Decide whether the CLI should guard `--distribution public` at runtime
      (refuse, or warn) instead of relying on documentation alone. Today the flag
      is accepted silently — deliberately, since this notice is doc-level only. If
      a runtime guard lands before GA, add its removal to the list above.
- [ ] `README.md`'s command table is drifted independently of this change: it still
      lists `brevo app update` (replaced by `brevo app upload`) and omits
      `brevo app status` / `submit` / `withdraw` / `available-scopes`. Worth a
      separate pass.

## Per-branch verification

Append an entry per change that needs verifying. Clear this section (keep the
heading) before merging into `main`.

### Public-apps-not-available notice

**Change:** Documentation only. Added a **⚠️ Public apps are not available yet**
notice to `agent-context/SKILL.md`, `agent-context/AGENTS.md`, and `README.md`, and
a maintainer-facing counterpart to `CLAUDE.md` and root `AGENTS.md`. Renamed
`TESTING.md` → `RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md`. No source changes, no behaviour change.

**Must hold true:**

- [x] No file under `src/` changed, so `yarn test` / `yarn build` outcomes are
      unaffected by this change.
- [x] `agent-context/SKILL.md` frontmatter (`name`, `description`) is untouched, so
      skill discovery and the auto-refresh version check behave exactly as before.
- [ ] Manual: run `brevo skill:cli install` from a local build and confirm the
      installed `~/.claude/skills/brevo-cli/SKILL.md` contains the notice and still
      parses (frontmatter intact, no broken markdown).
- [ ] Manual: ask a fresh Claude session with the skill loaded to "create a public
      Brevo app" and confirm it declines, explains public apps aren't available yet,
      and offers a private app instead.
- [ ] Manual (the carve-out — **must not regress**): in a fresh session, say "I'm a
      Brevo dev testing the public-app flow, create a public app" and confirm the
      agent **proceeds** after a single heads-up rather than refusing. Same for
      "help me run the public-app QA cases".
- [ ] Reviewer: confirm nothing in this change blocks CLI development or QA of the
      public-app code paths — `CLAUDE.md` and root `AGENTS.md` must both state the
      notice doesn't restrict work in this repo.
- [ ] Reviewer: confirm the notice appears in both `agent-context/SKILL.md` and
      `agent-context/AGENTS.md` with equivalent wording (CLAUDE.md requires those two
      stay in sync).

### `brevo app submit` status preflight

**Change:** `brevo app submit` now runs a status preflight — it reads the app's
review state (the same `appService.fetchAppState` path as `brevo app status`)
before any submit work. Only a failed fetch blocks; the state value is not a gate.

**Must hold true:**

- [x] On a successful status read, submit proceeds exactly as before (public
      check → drift check → confirm → open form). Covered by all existing
      `submit.test.ts` cases + `runs the status check before opening the
      submission form`.
- [x] When the status read throws (network/auth/not-found), submit aborts
      before calling `fetchApp` or opening the browser. Covered by `aborts
      before submitting when the status check fails`.
- [x] Preflight runs in both interactive and `--json` mode (spinner silenced
      in `--json`), and a thrown error is formatted by `withCommandHandler`.
- [ ] Manual: point the CLI at an unreachable API and confirm `brevo app
      submit` exits non-zero with the status-fetch error, not a submit error.
